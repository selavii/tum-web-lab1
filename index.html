    <p><strong>Liceul Teoretic "Mircea Eliade"</strong>2010-2022</p>
    <p>One of my favorite memories from school was the teamwork and camaraderie with my classmates during group projects. Whether it was late-night brainstorming sessions, intense coding marathons, or last-minute presentation rehearsals, we always supported each other. The laughter, shared struggles, and collective achievements made the learning experience unforgettable.</p>
